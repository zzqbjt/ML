Pedetrian_dectect is a SVM program.  
Group_discovery is a clustering program used DBscan.  
Classify is a program used to discriminate different types of leaves. I apply AlexNet and ResNet in this program.  
Spaceship Taitanic is a ML competition in Kaggle. I tried logistic, MLP, SVM and 1d convolutional network to solve the problem. In addition, I tried k-fold cross validation, bagging and other methods to improve the accuracy.  
Bot detection is a project which uses GNN to detect the bot in twitter. It's also the reproduction of RGCN.
